    <summary>A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in</summary>
    <description>A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in. Documentation is available on [its site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) or
in the `docs/content` folder of the repository.

### Supported content formats

- Zola: markdown
- Cobalt: markdown
- Hugo: markdown, asciidoc, org-mode
- Pelican: reStructuredText, markdown, asciidoc, org-mode, whatever-you-want

### Template engine explanation

Cobalt gets `~` as, while based on [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), the Rust library doesn't implement all its features but there is no documentation on what is and isn't implemented. The errors are also cryptic. Liquid itself is not powerful enough to do some of things you can do in Jinja2, Go templates or Tera.

Hugo gets `~`. It is probably the most powerful template engine in the list after Jinja2 (hard to beat python code in templates) but personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. Yes, this is a bit biased.

### Pelican notes
Many features of Pelican are coming from plugins, which might be tricky
to use because of version mismatch or lacking documentation. Netlify supports Python
and Pipenv but you still need to install your dependencies manually.

## Contributing
As the documentation site is automatically built on commits to master, all development
should happen on the `next` branch, unless it is fixing the current documentation.

If you want a feature added or modified, please open an issue to discuss it before doing a PR.
